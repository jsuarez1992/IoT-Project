For this assignment, we created a robot application based on Insdustry 4 needs. The robot goes to different working stations(aka. "lines"), pick up a parcel and drops it to a different station, then returns to base. 

## Presentation / Demo

The video demo was recorded on Centria, and the presentation was done using Canva. The recording is upload to Youtube and the link can be found [here](https://youtu.be/8rGpri0Pnkg).
