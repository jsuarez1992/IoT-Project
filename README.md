"For this assignment you have to develop an IoT application of your own. Your application must use the MQTT protocol which we have discussed in class, 
but you can connect any devices you want (phone, watch, sensors, laptop, fridge, car,...).

If you want you can use the small robots to create a “proof of concept” i.e. you use the robots instead of other devices 
to demonstrate how your application could work."
